## A · Session Rules

**A1 Model** — Haiku: explore / reads / search / format · Sonnet: implement / write · Opus: only after 2 fails on same task. Never default Opus because a task "feels hard."

**A2 Plan** — Atomic verifiable tasks before touching files. Log in `todo.md`. Identify Wave 1 (no blockers). Vague goals ("make it work") → ask before starting.

**A3 Execution workflow**
- Execute 1st pass only (no scope creep mid-wave)
- Before committing — mandatory gate: run the project's lint and test commands (check `package.json`, `Makefile`, `pyproject.toml`, or CI config for the right commands). Any red = stop, fix first.
- Business logic / public API / bug fix → tests required. Pure UI render → skip is OK, state why explicitly. Silence = not acceptable.
- Pure functions inside a component → extract to the project's lib/utils layer first, then test
- After each commit: update `todo.md` (remove closed rows + Details), append to `todo-done.md`, commit immediately — never leave either file dirty
- End of pass: rewrite `## Handoff` block in `todo.md` (replace, never append), commit, post the same block in chat

**A4 Token optimisation**
- Grep before Read — find line numbers, then read only those lines (`limit` + `offset`)
- No full-file reads on files >100 lines unless rewriting the whole file
- All independent tool calls in the same message (parallel)
- Cache `file:line` refs — never re-read the same file. Never re-Grep what an agent returned.
- Edit tool for partials; Write only for full rewrites. One logical change per commit.
- Don't refactor or optimise in the same pass as the feature/fix

**A5 Mindset** — State assumptions. No features / abstractions / error-handling beyond the ask. Every changed line traces to the request. Don't improve adjacent code. Remove imports made unused by your changes; leave pre-existing dead code alone and mention it.

**A6 Delivery** — Complete snippets with all imports. Explain WHY not what. Mark placeholders (`YOUR_API_KEY`). Flag security risks. No `TODO`/`FIXME` in delivered code.

**A7 Context gate** — The workflow checkpoint tracks session prompt depth. At 🟡 amber (~30 exchanges, ~75K tokens): complete the current task before starting anything new. At 🔴 red (~50 exchanges, ~125K tokens): finish the task in flight, run `/g-retro`, then tell the user to open a fresh session. Never start a new `/g-plan` at red. The handoff block in `todo.md` is the continuity contract — it must be current before the session ends.

**A8 Three-Strikes** — Same bug class × 3 attempts = STOP. Name the mechanism. List what failed and why. Find an alternative that bypasses it entirely. Escalate model before attempt 3, not after.
Warning signs: error message changes but bug class persists · you're explaining why *this* approach should work when the last one didn't · fix requires knowing internals of a platform component you don't control.
