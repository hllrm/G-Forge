## Active Session

```
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
HANDOFF — g-forge | branch: claude/m23-release-u3rx0d
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
Done this pass:   · v2.0.0 (M23) — production-readiness audit: hooks reconciled across hooks.json/g-init/g-doctor/g-update to one canonical 7-hook set · legacy "G-Team" naming purged from all live content · hook tests moved to tests/ · docs/agent-output/ git-ignored · docs/agents.md restored dependency-auditor (16→17) · §A7→§A8 ref fixes · README hook/concept counts + roadmap synced
Next up:          · M24 — open. No milestone in flight.
Active context:   · v2.0.0 shipped on branch claude/m23-release-u3rx0d. Name kept as G-Forge; README given a targeted clarity refresh (not a from-scratch rewrite — the audit confirmed existing content was accurate). Counts ground truth: 17 agents · 35 skills · 37 commands (35 skill-backed + /g-forge router + /g-team alias) · 56 profiles (48 stack + 7 combo + 1 supplementary).

---

### M8 — Deploy & Use
**Status:** ✅ Complete
**Version:** v0.9.0
**Goal:** Self-host G-Forge on this repo; add claude-plugin profile; add skill-design and skill-validate vibecoding skills
**Scope:**
- Install G-Forge into this repo (CLAUDE.md, hooks, settings.json, milestone files)
- Create milestones/M6, milestones/M7 files (retroactive)
- claude-plugin stack profile — architect agent + architecture rules
- /g-skill-design skill — guided workflow for designing new skills/agents
- /g-skill-validate skill — validates SKILL.md and agent files against quality criteria
- Register skill-design and skill-validate in commands/g-forge.md router

**Depends on:** —

---

### M9 — Intelligence Foundation
**Status:** ✅ Complete
**Version:** v0.10.0
**Goal:** Structural substrate for agent context management and decision memory
**Scope:**
- **Rename pass** — project renamed from G-Team → G-Forge; update all display strings, doc references, CHANGELOG heading, README, plugin.json `name`/`display_name`, marketplace.json, and any in-file prose mentioning "G-Team" across the full repo
- Context profiles v1 — memory slice declared in skill/agent frontmatter
- Memory layer taxonomy — 6 tiers (Working / Task / Sprint / Architectural / Institutional / Human Preference) with lifetime + audience
- ADR lineage fields — rejected alternatives, assumptions that held, constraints that drove the decision

**Depends on:** M8

---

### M10 — Organizational Learning Loop
**Status:** ✅ Complete
**Version:** v0.11.0
**Goal:** G-Forge detects recurring failure patterns and proposes self-corrections
**Scope:**
- /g-patterns skill — mines retros + todo-done for recurring failure modes; surfaces systemic health report
- Self-evolution — detected systemic pattern surfaces suggested fix to architecture profile rules, not just a report

**Depends on:** M9, accumulated retro/todo-done history

---

### M11 — Planning Intelligence
**Status:** ✅ Complete
**Version:** v0.12.0
**Goal:** /g-plan and /g-roadmap gain forecast, premortem, and in-flight health tracking
**Scope:**
- /g-forecast skill — scope realism analysis, complexity scoring, quantified risk estimate ("X% likely to miss target")
- Premortem wired into /g-forecast — ranked failure scenarios before plan approval, seeded by /g-patterns history
- Feedback loop closed — /g-patterns → premortem → /g-retro → /g-patterns
- Milestone health live monitoring — in-flight signal: blocker count, rework rate, review churn; surfaces via /g-help or hook

**Depends on:** M10 (/g-patterns must exist to seed premortem scenarios)

---

### M12 — Reliability & Adaptive Systems
**Status:** ✅ Complete
**Version:** v0.13.0
**Goal:** Instrument agent performance; system adapts its behavior based on measured reliability
**Scope:**
- 8-metric reliability telemetry: hallucination rate, review catch rate, regression frequency, rework rate, spec deviation, escalation frequency, token efficiency, retry dependency
- Adaptive orchestration — telemetry scores drive model selection and conditional reviewer spawning
- Governance intelligence — adaptive review gates by project stability and zone risk

**Depends on:** M11 (planning workflows must be instrumented before measuring them)

---

### M13 — Profile Additions
**Status:** ✅ Complete
**Version:** v0.14.0
**Goal:** Expand stack coverage and deepen existing frontend profiles
**Scope:**
- flask profile
- pygame profile
- xamarin profile
- dependency-auditor agent
- `frontend-data-flow` supplementary profile — rules + architect agent implementing the two-network model (read/write), dead-end component rule, and V1–V4 violation patterns; installed alongside any component-framework profile by `/g-specialize`
  - **Implementation note:** `/g-specialize` detection logic must be updated to auto-install `frontend-data-flow` whenever a component-framework stack is detected (vue-pinia, react, nuxt, next-js, sveltekit, angular, remix, astro, and composites). The profile is supplementary — it lives in its own directory and must be explicitly wired into the specialize skill's profile map; it will not activate automatically just by existing.

**Depends on:** M8 (independent of intelligence milestones; slots here as pacing break between M12 and M14)

---

### M14 — Advanced Production Modeling
**Status:** ✅ Complete
**Version:** v0.15.0
**Goal:** PM layer reasons about feature dependencies, costs, and long-term project trajectory
**Scope:**
- Dependency intelligence — feature-level dependency graph, blast radius analysis, volatility scoring; surfaces before execution ("this touches 4 high-volatility systems")
- Economic reasoning — token cost estimates, system impact counts, strategic deferral suggestions
- Temporal project cognition — persistent operational identity from accumulated signals: recurring risks, architectural personality, delivery patterns

**Depends on:** M12 (telemetry data), M10 (pattern history), M11 (blast radius feeds /g-forecast)

---

### M15 — Hook / Behavioral Integration Pass
**Status:** ✅ Complete — v1.0.0 shipped
**Version:** v1.0.0
**Goal:** G-Forge becomes a coherent production intelligence system, not a collection of additions
**Scope:**
- Full hook audit and behavioral flow wiring end-to-end
- Health surfaces in /g-help; premortem auto-runs in /g-plan; pattern suggestions feed /g-retro output
- UX tuning across the full system — flows feel cohesive, not additive

**Depends on:** M14 (all capabilities must be in place before the integration pass)

---

### M19 — Ambient Proactivity
**Status:** ✅ Complete
**Version:** v1.6.0
**Goal:** G-Forge watches continuously, stays anchored to the brief, and reacts to feature drops — less command-driven, more ambient
**Scope:**
- Silent observer (`hooks/observe.sh` + `hooks/agent-lifecycle.sh`) — passive `.claude/journal/` activity log; `/g-retro` reworked to synthesize from it (no interview)
- `/g-align` — brief-deviation check vs `project_brief.md`; auto-runs at milestone close, nudged between milestones; advisory
- `/g-intake` — proactive feature-drop triage (classify against brief → propose placement + version + risk → ask before writing)
- Hardened the JSON-parse cascade across all hooks (no fail-open on the Windows python3 stub)

**Depends on:** M18 (compact-return + plan-derisking foundation)

> Note: M16–M18 shipped between M15 and M19 (see CHANGELOG and README roadmap table for v1.2.0 / v1.3.3 / v1.5.0) — this file tracks the headline milestones.

---

### M20 — Single-Use Agent Doctrine
**Status:** ✅ Complete
**Version:** v1.7.0
**Goal:** Make context poisoning structurally impossible — agents are single-use; retries live at HQ via clean learnings reports, not inside a degrading executor context
**Scope:**
- Single-use agent doctrine in G-RULES §C — one approach, one attempt; names and prevents context poisoning
- `FAILED` agent outcome + `LEARNINGS:` field in the return contract, distinct from `BLOCKED`
- `/g-execute` redeploy loop — HQ analyzes learnings and deploys a fresh agent with a different mechanism, bounded by Three-Strikes (§A8), then escalates to the human
- Doctrine note in `docs/orchestration-patterns.md` framing it as the automatable form of the deliberation/execution split

**Depends on:** M18 (compact-return contract this extends)

---

### M21 — Decision Hygiene Loop
**Status:** ✅ Complete
**Version:** v1.8.0
**Goal:** Apply the single-use doctrine to HQ's own deliberation and close the loop — high-stakes thinking happens off-context, and the session resets after a decision is finalized
**Scope:**
- `/g-adr` offloads the weighing to a throwaway deliberation subagent; HQ promotes only the finalized draft (HQ window stays clean)
- Decision-hygiene reset reuses the §A7 context-gate path on a semantic trigger — `/g-retro` + handoff (`verify ADR-NNN` first) + fresh-session recommendation
- G-RULES §C extended with HQ deliberation hygiene; orchestration-patterns doctrine section extended

**Depends on:** M20 (single-use agent doctrine this generalizes to HQ)

---

### M22 — Session Re-entry
**Status:** ✅ Complete
**Version:** v1.9.0
**Goal:** Make "start a fresh session" cheap — the read side of the reset seam, so a clean window re-hydrates the right slice of the durable record instead of inheriting a poisoned one
**Scope:**
- `/g-resume` — selective re-hydration: pulls the relevant retro cold-start, in-force ADRs, journal tail, and handoff first-task into a clean window, keyed to branch/milestone/first-task; offers the clean-slate ADR verification when one was handed off
- First-prompt `/g-resume` nudge in `workflow-checkpoint.sh` when a handoff is pending
- §A7 reframed as a two-sided reset (promote out via `/g-retro`; re-hydrate in via `/g-resume`); orchestration-patterns doctrine extended with the read side

**Depends on:** M19 (observer journal), M20–M21 (the reset path `/g-resume` re-enters from)

---

### M23 — G-Forge 2.0 (Production-Readiness Audit)
**Status:** ✅ Complete
**Version:** v2.0.0
**Depends on:** all prior milestones (this audits the whole surface).

Self-contained kickoff — paste the block below into a fresh session (or open cold and run `/g-resume`, which points here):

```
G-Forge 2.0 — production-readiness audit. The bar: "no shit." Ruthless pass for
consistency, clarity, and shippability. No half-measures, no leftover cruft, no
stale docs, no claims the repo doesn't back up. Fix what you find; don't just report.

Work on a fresh branch (e.g. claude/g-forge-2.0-audit). Do NOT push to main without
explicit approval. Use G-Forge's own tooling where it fits (/g-audit, /g-docs,
/g-doctor, /g-review). Keep CHANGELOG.md AND README in sync as part of "done" for
every change — standing rule, not an afterthought.

EXPLICIT DELIVERABLES
1. .gitignore — review and tighten. Confirm it excludes everything generated
   (.claude/ runtime, scratch, agent-output, journals, sentinels, OS files) and
   nothing that is real plugin content. (Current file uses legacy "G-Team" wording.)
2. Clean the repo — remove dead/stray files; decide what should not ship. Known:
   hooks/test-check-commit.sh and hooks/test-observe.sh ship in hooks/ — move to a
   tests/ dir or exclude. Sweep orphaned references, dead links, placeholder files.
3. Agents <> hooks reconciliation — every agent a skill references exists (17
   present); every hook in hooks/hooks.json matches g-init's install table AND
   g-doctor's checks (paths, names, registration); nothing referenced-but-missing
   or installed-but-unregistered.
4. README v2 — rewrite from scratch (don't patch). Start under a PLACEHOLDER project
   name; keep the real name out until content is approved, then swap it in one pass.

CONSISTENCY / CLARITY SWEEP (seeded findings — start here, don't stop here)
- Legacy "G-Team" strings still in: hooks/hooks.json, hooks/pre-compact.sh,
  hooks/check-commit.sh, hooks/post-commit-cleanup.sh, hooks/workflow-checkpoint.sh,
  ROADMAP.md. Rename to G-Forge (leave historical retros untouched).
- Count claims vs reality: marketplace.json says "17 agents, 35 skills" but there
  are 37 commands and 35 skill dirs. Reconcile everywhere they appear (marketplace.json,
  README, CHANGELOG, /g-help) against ground truth.
- Docs vs recent behavior: /g-adr is now a 9-step flow (entry triage, capture mode,
  reversibility + premortem); the §A7 context gate now prevents compaction
  (auto-calibrating thresholds, amber active-monitoring, wave /context checks). Check
  every doc that describes these (README, G-RULES, docs/orchestration-patterns.md,
  skill/command descriptions) for stale step numbers / thresholds.
- One voice: descriptions, headers, terminology consistent across commands/, skills/,
  agents/, rules/, docs/.

VERSION: major — bump to 2.0.0 only when the audit is genuinely complete and you'd
stake "production ready" on it. Developer approves the bump.

DONE = repo clean; .gitignore correct; agents<>hooks fully reconciled; zero legacy
naming; all counts/claims true; README v2 approved and named; CHANGELOG + docs in
sync; /g-doctor green. If something can't be made production-ready in scope, say so
plainly with the reason — don't paper over it.
```
